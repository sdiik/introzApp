# introzApp

this application is an IOS application where it looks similar to facebook.
This UI is created without using the Storyboard.
UI in this application:
- Splash Screen
- Login
- registration
- Forgot the password
- Bottom Navigation :
  - Home (latest news list)
  - Friends (friend list list that you can cancel)
  - Notification (UI notification which usually comes from firebase)
  - Settings (consisting of your data, and profile edit feature, about and bottom logout).

This UI is full of flaws and maybe all of you can help improve.
