# introzApp

this application is an IOS application where it looks similar to facebook.
This UI is created without using the Storyboard.
UI in this application:
- Splash Screen
- Login
- registration
- Forgot the password
- Bottom Navigation:
  -> Home (latest news list)
  -> Friends (friend list list that you can cancel)
  -> Notification (UI notification which usually comes from firebase)
  -> Settings (consisting of your data, and profile edit feature, about and bottom logout).

This UI is full of flaws
May be useful
